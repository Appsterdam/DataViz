### TODOs

- Group topics in a more realted way (Iphone, Iphone-x, iphone-x-xx- as iphone)
- Pictures of members
- Events, man
- Group members of Appsterdam based on their event attendance (eg. open space is mainly for designers, guru sessions for techies)
- check clock gem
- Use to_json Ruby method to filter the fields, rather than respond_to :json which returns all the fields
- paginate on model level



### Examples

## The OO Way

Bad:

    member = Member.first
    Member.membertopictitles(member).each { |name| puts name }
    Member.all.map do |m|
       Member.membertopictitles(member)
    end.flatten.uniq

Good:

    Member.first.topic_titles.each { |name| puts name }
    Member.all.map(&:topic_titles).flatten.uniq

   ...or:

    Member.first.topics.titles.each { |name| puts name }
