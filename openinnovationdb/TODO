### Examples

## The OO Way

Bad:

    member = Member.first
    Member.membertopictitles(member).each { |name| puts name }
    Member.all.map do |m|
       Member.membertopictitles(member)
    end.flatten.uniq

Good:

    Member.first.topic_titles.each { |name| puts name }
    Member.all.map(&:topic_titles).flatten.uniq

   ...or:

    Member.first.topics.titles.each { |name| puts name }
